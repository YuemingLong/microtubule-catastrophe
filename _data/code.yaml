    Looks at the data for microtubule catastrophe with labeled
    and unlabeled tubulin to see if there is a difference in 
    their distributions by plotting their ECDFs, constructing
    confidence intervals for the mean time to catastrophe,
    and performing a permutation test.

    Looks at the labeled tubulin data to compute the maximum
    likelihood estimates with confidence intervalsvfor the
    parameters of the gamma-distributed model and the two-step model.

  desc: >
    Looks at the data with a 12 uM tubulin concentration to perform
    model comparison between the gamma-distributed model 
    and the two-step model using Q-Q plots, predictive ECDFs,
    and the Akaike Information Criterion.

  desc: >
    Looks at the catastrophe times for different concentrations of
    tubulin and calculates maximum likelihood estimates for the 
    gamma-distributed model for each concentration.
