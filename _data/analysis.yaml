  Our first task was to understand why the time to catastrophe may be gamma-distributed, as
  Gardner et. al. proposed to model them. The idea behind potentially using the gamma distribution
  to describe microtubule catastrophe is that the catastrophe process is promoted by certain
  factors, one of which was proposed in the paper to be kinesin-8 Kip3. These factors bind to 
  a microtubule according to a Poisson process, a pattern that many biological processes exhibit.
  Once a critical number of these factors have become bound to a specific microtubule (the number 
  was found to be about 3 in the paper), the microtubule becomes much more prone to catastrophe. 
  The gamma distribution can then describe this overall process because the gamma distribution 
  represents the total time for a certain number of arrivals of a Poisson process. Thus, the gamma
  distribution might work to model microtubule catastrophe by approximating the proposed biological
  process of a critical number of catastrophe factors binding to the microtubule in the fashion
  of a Poisson process.

  We then wanted to understand the second model where we proposed that physically, two biochemical
  processes have to happen in succession to trigger catastrophe, with each step in the process 
  modeled using an exponential distribution, representing a Poisson process. Mathematically, we
  wanted to derive the PDF for our model as follows.
Analysis3: >
  From the PDF of an exponential distribution, we know that
  $$f(t;\beta_1) = \beta_1 e^{-\beta_1 t}$$
  and 
  $$ f(t;\beta_2) = \beta_2 e^{-\beta_2 t}.$$
  The distribution that we are looking for is the distribution of the sum of the times for processes
  1 and 2, which is given by the convolution of their two PDFs given above. The integral runs from
  $0$ to $t$ because this is the domain on which the functions are defined since $\tau$ must be 
  greater than $0$ for $\beta_1$ and must be less than $t$ for $\beta_2$.
  $$f(t ; \beta_1, \beta_2) = \int_0^t{f(\tau; \beta_1) \cdot f(t-\tau; \beta_2) d\tau}$$
  $$ = \int_0^t{\beta_1 e^{-\beta_1 \tau} \cdot \beta_2 e^{-\beta_2 (t-\tau)}d\tau}$$
  $$ = \beta_1 \beta_2 e^{-\beta_2 t} \frac{1}{\beta_2 - \beta_1} (e^{-\beta_2 \tau - \beta_1 \tau}) \Big|_0^t$$
  $$ \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2}{\beta_2 - \beta_1} e^{-\beta_2 t} (e^{\beta_2 t} e^{-\beta_1 t} - 1)$$
  $$ \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2}{\beta_2 - \beta_1} (e^{-\beta_1 t} - e^{-\beta_2 t}) \end{aligned}$$
  Thus, we derived the PDF of the multi-step Poisson process from the PDFs of the individual component processes.

  To compare the two models, we needed to find the maximum likelihood estimates of each model's parameters.
  To do so, we used numerical optimization methods (carried out in mle.py on this website) to find
  point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.
Analysis5: >
  For the gamma-distributed model, the MLE for $\alpha$ is about 2.4 with a confidence interval of about
  2.08 to 2.9 (depending on the random draw); the MLE for $\beta$ is about 0.0055 with a confidence interval
  from about 0.0045 to 0.0068 (again, depending on randomness). These values suggest that generally two arrival
  events are required before microtubule catastrophe starts, and by three arrival events, almost all microtubules
  have undergone catastrophe. These events have an average arrival time of about 
  $\frac{1}{\beta}=\frac{1}{0.0055\ s^{-1}}=181.82\ s$. These values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ seem to make sense 
  given the data. These results are also in agreement with the paper since they found that the MLE for 
  $\alpha$ at 12 $\mu$M was 2.93.
Analysis6: >
  For the two-step model, the MLE for $\beta_1$ was about 0.0082, which was the same for $\beta_2$.
  The 95% confidence intervals were found to be from about 0.0070 to about 0.0100 for $\beta_1$ and 
  from about 0.0071 to about 0.0102 for $/beta2$. This suggests that the model is actually best when 
  it reduces to a Gamma distribution with $\alpha = 2$.

  We then performed some exploratory analysis of the times to catastrophe at differing tubulin concentrations.
  The plot developed for this is shown in the Interactive Figure page of this website. There are several
  interesting features in the plot. In general, it seems that the time to catastrophe increases with 
  concentration. There are several possible explanations for this. Since microtubules polymerize faster with 
  higher tubulin concentration, at higher concentrations the microtubules will on average be longer. This may
  suggest that longer microtubules are more stable than shorter ones, leading to a longer time to catastrophe
  for higher concentrations. Another explanation is that at greater concentrations, tubulin makes up a greater
  proportion of the molecules at the end of the microtubule where synthesis is occurring while the factors 
  that are associated with depolymerization make up a smaller proportion. This means that there is greater
  time between interactions between the microtubule and the depolymerization factor because it is less 
  likely to interact, leading to a longer time to catastrophe.
Analysis8: >
  To compare our two models we used the data collected at a tubulin concentration of 12 uM.
  For model comparison, we first made Q-Q plots showing the observed data against simulated data drawn
  from our theoretical distributions. These plots are Figures 3 and 4 on this website. From the Q-Q plots,
  we see that the gamma-distributed model matches the data much better than the two-step process model, 
  although the fit is still not great. At least the gamma model is close to the data near the bounds of the
  plot and is somewhat close in the middle, but the two-step model misses the data entirely. One interesting
  feature is that the shape of the Q-Q plot is essentially the same for both models, just at a different 
  angle. This is presumably because $\beta_1 \approx \beta_2$, which means that the two-step model is
  essentially a gamma distribution with $\alpha = 2$, so the two plots are essentially scaled versions of
  one another according to the different parameters.
Analysis9: >
  We also generated predictive ECDFs from our theoretical distributions to perform model comparison. The
  plots generated are Figures 5 and 6 on this website. From the predictive ECDFs we conclude that the 
  gamma-distributed model is much better than the two-step process model. Again, we see the deviation 
  for catastrophe times in the middle of the range, but it is much better than the gamma model, which
  never comes close to the data's ECDF. This result makes sense given that $\beta_1 \approx \beta_2$
  because in that limit, the two-step model becomes a gamma distribution with $\alpha = 2$, while the
  gamma distribution model still has a free parameter in $\alpha$ to be able to better fit the data.
Analysis10: >
  As a final test, we calculated the Akaike weights for the models. The weight for the gamma model was
  found to be essentially 0, and the weight for the two-step model was essentially 1 (the numbers were
  so close to 0 and 1 that this is what the computer reports). Despite what the AIC tells us, we still
  prefer the gamma model because it actually comes close to fitting the data, while the two-step model
  is not even close. The counter-intuitive results for the Akaike weights are likely because of a very
  broad log likelihood for the gamma model, while the two-step model must have a much sharper peak at 
  where $\beta_1 \approx \beta_2$. In this case, the importance of the model fit outweighs (pun intended)
  the somewhat arbitrary AIC, which is based on "information loss", so we will proceed using the 
  gamma-distributed model.
Analysis11: >
  The final step was to compute parameter estimates for our preferred model (the gamma-distributed model)
  using maximum likelihood estimation. We plotted the resulting point estimates and 95% confidence
  intervals in Figures 7 and 8 on this website. For brevity, we will only report the point estimates
  here. For 7 uM, $\alpha$ was 2.44 and $\beta$ was 0.0076. For 9 uM, $\alpha$ was 2.68 and $\beta$ was 0.0088.
  For 10 uM, $\alpha$ was 3.21 and $\beta$ was 0.0090. For 12 uM, $\alpha$ was 2.92 and $\beta$ was 0.0077.
  For 14 uM, $\alpha$ was 3.36 and $\beta$ was 0.0072.
Analysis12: >
  In general, it seems like $\alpha$ increases with concentration (with the exception of at 12 uM). 
  There is not as distinct a trend for $\beta$, so perhaps the rate at which the event occurs is not 
  very relevant when comparing across concentrations. In that case, the relevant factor is the number 
  of times that the event occurs before catastrophe, given by $\alpha$. This also might explain why the
  AIC in part b gave such counter-intuitive results. The value of $\beta$ is not particularly important
  in modeling the data, which likely gives rise to a broad log likelihood, but from our graphical 
  analysis, we know that the importance of $\alpha$ as a parameter makes the gamma model preferable 
  to the two-step model.
Analysis13: >
  Given the biological context that we are working in, the parameter values may suggest the following: 
  We know that the rate at which the event occurs doesn't vary much between concentrations 
  ($\beta$ doesn't change significantly) but the number of events does ($\alpha$ has a strong and clear trend)
  , and we know that at higher concentrations microtubules will polymerize faster. Suppose that catastrophe 
  occurs when a certain number of events occur within a certain period of time. We know that catastrophe is 
  likely caused by the binding of some molecule or molecules, so physically, we are considering the scenario
  where a certain number of catastrophizing molecules (molecules that promote or cause catastrophe) bind 
  within a certain region of the microtubule to create a sort of "catastrophizing density". Also suppose that
  these molecules bind only at the end where polymerization is occurring. If the rate at which these molecules
  bind a microtubule is roughly constant, as it seems to be from the parameter estimates, then at higher 
  concentrations, it is harder for enough of the molecules to bind in a small enough region to trigger 
  catastrophe because the microtubule is growing at a faster rate at higher concentrations. Thus, it takes
  more of these events to occur before it happens that they occur close enough to generate a catastrophizing
  density, resulting in a larger value of $\alpha$ at higher concentrations, which is what we saw in our analysis.
