  Analysis of Micrutubule Catastrophe Time

Abstract: >
  Evidence suggests that microtubule catastrophe—the rapid depolymerization of a 
  microtubule filament that follows a period of slower microtubule growth—is the 
  result of a multistep process. This is result of Gardner, Zanic, and coworkers.
  We proposed two multistep models to describe the time to microtubule catastrophe
  and used the data from Gardner et. al. to select the preferred model.
  Modeling the process as gamma-distributed—with alpha 2.41 and beta 0.0055 obtained
  by maximum likelihood estimation—was found to better describe the data than 
  modeling it as two exponentially-distributed events occuring in sequence.
  Subsequent analysis of catastrophe times at differing tubulin concentrations
  using the gamma-distributed model found that alpha played a much larger role than
  beta in determining catastrophe times. This suggests a physical model for 
  microtubule catastrophe in which catastrophe becomes likely once a certain 
  density of catastrophy-promoting molecules bind to the microtubule.
